Collection of tools and libraries I share for C programming and shell scripting

The objective is to share freely projects I have made to ease programming and
developing mainly from the cli

The makefiles are designed for the ELF format, using a GNU gcc compatible
compiler/linker if you intend to compile for anything else, then you will need
to rework the makefiles and the licencing modules in the libraries will need to
be reworked too, so that their licencing information is included in your
licencing information in order to make the licenses "binary reproducible".
