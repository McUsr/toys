/* Revision: [main cefba3a]
 * I have started to use exception handling, to trap assertions, in order to
 * provide a more "end-user" friendly error message, so exception and assert is
 * now incorporated in libmiscutil.
 *
 * Include the regular `assert.h` during initial development for maximum details
 * when a checked runtime error occurs (assert() is triggered). Use this when
 * the software is released, including the TRY ELSE FINALLY ENDTRY except.h
 * exception handling in main. (When using the regular assert, that code is
 * stale, but that is what you want anyway then ).
 *
 * I developed the idea to cover up for the "eprintf" routines as well, which
 * deal with system calls for the most part that we discover has gone awry by
 * their return value, and errno, and not assertions.
 *
 * The module is now runtime configurable by choice, and for the case we
 * configure the system by default to be in REL - release mode, we print a user
 * friendly message, this message we can write ourselves, and serves as a
 * unified general message if something other than user error ("die()") happens.
 *
 * In end user mode (REL - release), the "die" message still provides an error
 * message as to what went wrong, giving the user a fair chance to remedy the
 * sitution, but any details such as error codes are omitted.
 *
 * The warning message (weprintf) are muted when in end user mode in order to
 * not create uncertainty.
 *
 * In order to get end-user error messsages you need to
 * 'setErrorMessageMode(REL)' in your code, since 'DEV' is the default.
